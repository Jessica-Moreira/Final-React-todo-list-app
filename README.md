# ABOUT THE APP
Welcome to Proactive! Where you can quit procrastinating and use our Proactive Tracker to track how proactive you've been that day! Proactive works like any todo list, you just type in what you wish to accomplish and track what you have completed by checking the boxes. You can see your progress by clicking through the tabs of active and completed.
